    <h1>Naming Convention: Three rules to follow when naming files for the web</h1>
        <p>All lowercase: Because different operating systems treat capitalization differently.
            No spaces! Because URLs cannot have spaces in them.
            Only letters, numbers, and dashes (-) Because URLs use a limited set of characters & dashes are word separators while underscores are word connectors.

  <h3>Accessibility and Its Importance</h3>
  <p>Accessibility refers to the design and development of websites and applications that are easily accessible and usable by people with disabilities. Accessibility is important because it helps ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use the web. By designing accessible websites, we can create a more inclusive online environment and promote equal opportunities for all users. Some important accessibility properties include landmark roles, aria labels, and image alternative texts.
</p>

    <h3>CSS and its Implementation in HTML</h3>
  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). By using CSS, we can control the appearance of web pages, including fonts, colors, layout, and other visual elements. To implement CSS in an HTML file, we need to use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the head section of the HTML file and reference the CSS file location using the <code>href</code> attribute.
  </p>

  <h3>CSS Property vs Value</h3>
  <p>In CSS, a property is a characteristic of an element that we want to modify, such as color or font-size. A value, on the other hand, is the setting or measurement we apply to the property. For example, the color property can have values like red, blue, or #00ff00 (hexadecimal color code).
  </p>

  <h3>Border-box Property in CSS</h3>
  <p>The border-box property in CSS is used to change the box-sizing model of an element from the default content-box to border-box. This means that the element's border and padding values will be included in the overall width and height of the element, rather than being added to it.
 </p>
  
  <h3>Adding Spacing to an Element</h3>
  <p>There are several ways to add spacing to an element in CSS, including using margin, padding, line-height, and border. We can use these properties to adjust the positioning and layout of elements on a web page.
 </p>

  <h3>Margin vs Padding</h3>
  <p>Margin and padding are both CSS properties used to add spacing around an element, but they have different effects. Margin adds space outside of an element, while padding adds space inside of an element. In other words, margin affects the space between elements, while padding affects the space between an element's content and its border.
 </p>

  <h3>Display Properties</h3>
  <p>Display properties in CSS determine how an element should be displayed on a web page. Some common display properties include block, inline, inline-block, and none.
 </p>

  <h3>Flexbox Property</h3>
  <p>Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that provides an efficient way to align and distribute space among items in a container. By using flexbox, we can easily create responsive and dynamic layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.
 </p>

  <h3>Types of Flexbox Properties</h3>
  <p>Some common flexbox properties include flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap. These properties are used to control the direction, alignment, and wrapping of flex items within a container.
  </p>

  <h3>Using Flexbox Property with Code</h3>
 <p>To use the flexbox property on a parent element, we need to set the display property to flex. We can also use sub-properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to customize the layout of the flex container.
 </p> 

  <h3>Example of Flexbox Property with Code</h3>
  <p>To use the flexbox property on a parent element, we can add the following code to our CSS file:
  </p>
  
  <code>
  .parent {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  </code>
