    <h1>Naming Convention: Three rules to follow when naming files for the web</h1>
        <p>All lowercase: Because different operating systems treat capitalization differently.
            No spaces! Because URLs cannot have spaces in them.
            Only letters, numbers, and dashes (-) Because URLs use a limited set of characters & dashes are word separators while underscores are word connectors.

  <h3>Accessibility and Its Importance</h3>
  <p>Accessibility refers to the design and development of websites and applications that are easily accessible and usable by people with disabilities. Accessibility is important because it helps ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use the web. By designing accessible websites, we can create a more inclusive online environment and promote equal opportunities for all users. Some important accessibility properties include landmark roles, aria labels, and image alternative texts.
</p>

    <h3>CSS and its Implementation in HTML</h3>
  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). By using CSS, we can control the appearance of web pages, including fonts, colors, layout, and other visual elements. To implement CSS in an HTML file, we need to use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the head section of the HTML file and reference the CSS file location using the <code>href</code> attribute.
  </p>

  <h3>CSS Property vs Value</h3>
  <p>In CSS, a property is a characteristic of an element that we want to modify, such as color or font-size. A value, on the other hand, is the setting or measurement we apply to the property. For example, the color property can have values like red, blue, or #00ff00 (hexadecimal color code).
  </p>

  <h3>Border-box Property in CSS</h3>
  <p>The border-box property in CSS is used to change the box-sizing model of an element from the default content-box to border-box. This means that the element's border and padding values will be included in the overall width and height of the element, rather than being added to it.
 </p>
  
  <h3>Adding Spacing to an Element</h3>
  <p>There are several ways to add spacing to an element in CSS, including using margin, padding, line-height, and border. We can use these properties to adjust the positioning and layout of elements on a web page.
 </p>

  <h3>Margin vs Padding</h3>
  <p>Margin and padding are both CSS properties used to add spacing around an element, but they have different effects. Margin adds space outside of an element, while padding adds space inside of an element. In other words, margin affects the space between elements, while padding affects the space between an element's content and its border.
 </p>

  <h3>Display Properties</h3>
  <p>Display properties in CSS determine how an element should be displayed on a web page. Some common display properties include block, inline, inline-block, and none.
 </p>

  <h3>Flexbox Property</h3>
  <p>Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that provides an efficient way to align and distribute space among items in a container. By using flexbox, we can easily create responsive and dynamic layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.
 </p>

  <h3>Types of Flexbox Properties</h3>
  <p>Some common flexbox properties include flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap. These properties are used to control the direction, alignment, and wrapping of flex items within a container.
  </p>

  <h3>Using Flexbox Property with Code</h3>
 <p>To use the flexbox property on a parent element, we need to set the display property to flex. We can also use sub-properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to customize the layout of the flex container.
 </p> 

  <h3>Example of Flexbox Property with Code</h3>
  <p>To use the flexbox property on a parent element, we can add the following code to our CSS file:
  </p>

  <code>
  .parent {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  </code>



  <h3>Different Types of Flexbox Properties</h3>
  <p>There are several flexbox properties, such as flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap. These properties control the direction, alignment, and spacing of flex items within a flex container. </p>
  <h3>Using Flexbox Property on a Parent Element</h3>
  <p> To use flexbox on a parent element, set the display property to "flex". You can then use sub-properties like flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap to control the layout and alignment of the child elements.</p>
  <h3>Code Example for Flexbox Property</h3>
  <p> Here's an example of how to use the flexbox property on a parent element:
  <code>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  </code>
  This code sets the container element to use flexbox, arranges the child elements in a row, centers them horizontally, and centers them vertically. </p>
  
  <h3>CSS Grid Property</h3>
  <p> CSS Grid is a layout system that allows for creating complex and responsive layouts with ease. It works by defining a grid of rows and columns, and then placing elements within that grid. </p>
  <h3>Parent and Sub-Properties for CSS Grid Property</h3>
  <p> To use the CSS Grid property, you need to set the display property of the parent element to "grid". You can then use sub-properties like grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the size and number of columns and rows in the grid. </p>
  <h3>Difference Between display: flex and display: grid</h3>
  <p>The main difference between display: flex and display: grid is that flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns), while CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns). </p>
  <h3>Sub-Property Used to Divide Elements in CSS Grid</h3>
  <p>To divide elements in CSS Grid, you can use the grid-column and grid-row properties to specify which cells the elements should occupy in the grid. </p>
  <h3>Unit Used to Fractionally Divide Element Width in CSS Grid</h3>
  <p>The unit used to fractionally divide the element width in CSS Grid is the "fr" unit. It represents a fraction of the available space in the grid. Alternatively, you can use other units like percentages or pixels.
  Here's an example of how to use the "fr" unit in CSS Grid: 
  <code> .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  }
  </code>
  This code creates a grid with three columns, where the middle column is twice as wide as the others.
  </p>
  <h3>Area Property in CSS Grid</h3>
  <p> The area property in CSS Grid is used to specify which cells an element should occupy in the grid. You can use it to place an element in a specific row and column, or span multiple rows or columns. </p>
  
  <h3>Parent and Sub-Properties for CSS Grid Property</h3>
  <p> CSS Grid is a two-dimensional grid layout system that allows for more advanced and flexible layouts than traditional one-dimensional layouts. To use CSS Grid, you first define a parent element as the grid container and then apply the necessary properties to create the desired layout. Two commonly used sub-properties for the CSS Grid property are `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`. These properties allow you to define the size and number of columns and rows in the grid layout. </p>
  <h3>Difference Between display: flex and display: grid</h3>
  <p> While both `display: flex` and `display: grid` are layout systems in CSS, they have different use cases. Flexbox is typically used for one-dimensional layouts, such as arranging items along a single row or column. Grid, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to create complex grid-based designs. </p>
  <h3>Sub-Property to Divide Elements in CSS Grid Properties</h3>
  <p> The `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties are used to specify which rows or columns an element should span in a CSS Grid layout. These properties allow you to divide elements into cells within the grid, controlling their placement and size. </p>
  <h3>Fractional Unit and Alternatives for CSS Grid Property</h3>
  <p> In CSS Grid, the fractional unit `fr` is often used to divide the available space in the grid layout. This unit allows you to specify the size of each grid column or row as a fraction of the available space. Other alternatives include using fixed pixel or percentage values for column or row sizes, or using the `auto` keyword to let the grid automatically size the columns or rows based on their content. </p>
  <h3>Area Property in CSS Grid</h3>
  <p> In CSS Grid, the `grid-area` property is used to place an item onto the grid by referencing the grid lines or named grid areas. This property allows you to specify both the starting and ending points for an element within the grid, allowing for precise control over its position and size. </p>
  <h3>Preventing Display of Empty Columns in CSS Grid</h3>
  <p> The `grid-auto-flow` property is used in CSS Grid to define how items are placed on the grid when there is extra space available. By default, this property is set to `row`, which means items are placed left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Setting `grid-auto-flow` to `column` will place items in columns first, which can prevent the display of empty columns in the grid. </p>
