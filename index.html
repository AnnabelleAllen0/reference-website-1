    <h1>Naming Convention: Three rules to follow when naming files for the web</h1>
        <p>All lowercase: Because different operating systems treat capitalization differently.
            No spaces! Because URLs cannot have spaces in them.
            Only letters, numbers, and dashes (-) Because URLs use a limited set of characters & dashes are word separators while underscores are word connectors.
